To download data from Pinterest, you should make use of the [Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2)

Most public data on Tumblr is available over the API.

To see a list of all possible endpoints on the API, visit the reference: [https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2)

The reference will also explain what information you can get out of the *Blog* and *Tag* endpoints.
